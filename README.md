# Daily activity profiles associated with incident cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality in older adults

**01 - Exploratory analyses**
- (1) 2D and 3D plots: hypotheses of clusters;
- (2) description of the population: mean and standard deviation for physical activity (PA) features; examining differences in PA metrics between day types (weekdays or weekend days);
- (4) redundancy of the PA metrics: correlation coeficients, correlations plots;

**02 - Identification of profiles of movement behavior using k-means**
