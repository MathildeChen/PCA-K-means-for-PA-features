# Daily activity profiles associated with incident cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality in older adults

**Exploratory analyses**
- (1) 2D and 3D plots: hypotheses of clusters;
- (2) description of the population (means and SD for continous variables, proportion for categorical variables); 
- (3) means and standard deviation for physical activity (PA) features; 
- (4) look at PA metrics differences between day types (weekdays or weekend days);
- (5) redundancy of the PA metrics: correlations plots

**Preliminary analyses** 
- (1) PA profiles using PCA and k-means (analysis on all days, or stratified by day type);
- (2) Describe PA profiles by PA features: means and standard deviation of physical activity (PA) features in the different profiles;
- (3) Explore association between profiles and covariates: descriptive statistics and differences in covariates between the different groups identified by PCA (> or < median PC) and k-means;

**Main analyses**
- Explore associations between PA profiles and health outcome
- Explore association between covariates and physical activity features: univariate regression
